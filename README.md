#Instructions

This lab will create a digital clock. Begin by planning out your object(s) with UML. Once your UML document is complete, create a DigitalClock class with the following:

Properties (note: you may use as many properties as you need, but the following are needed to display time)

-hours
-minutes
-seconds
-meridiem (AM/PM)

Methods (try creating the following methods to return time values for you output)

-getHours - to return hours
-getMinutes - to return minutes
-getSeconds - to return seconds
-getMeridiem - to return AM/PM
-Remember to comment your code

Use the DATE() object to get the current time

Use the setInterval() method to update you clock
